# Grading-Assistant
This repo contains the script that launches a grading assistant locally in the browser. The grading assistant can be applied to homework and exams in all types of submissions. By leveraging the grading assistant, graders can efficiently grade a course with dozens or even hundreds of students, while ensuring that the rubric is easily adjustable and consistent. The grading assistant keeps track of the distribution of mistakes and can allow graders to easily view the report of all or a subset of questions. In addition, the grading assistant gives graders the freedom to add individualized comments for each rubric item. It can also save and load intermediate progress easily.
