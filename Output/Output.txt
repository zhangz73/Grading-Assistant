Example Student1: 97
Completed
-1: Q1b. Minor computation errors. #comment#: The numerator of the trace should be p rather than 1.
-1: Q1d(iv). ||x||^{-2} is not a constant and therefore E[] cannot be removed.
-1: Q1e. The MSE of the James-Stein estimator is NOT monotonic as p increases. Recall that its MSE is quadratic.

Example Student2: 94
Completed
-4: Q1e. Missing or severely incorrect explanation.
-2: Q2c. Missing or misunderstanding the keyword "convex". #comment#: Differentiable is completely different from convexity. In this question, both objective functions are differentiable but only q=4 is convex.
